<h1>HOME OF THE BRAVE</h1>
<p>The home of the brave is a very emotional action american movie. It is based on a true life story of the american armed forces
    it shows all the kinds of suffering which soldiers go through in war and why they should be respected and treated like heros.
    The day after they get the word that they'll go home in two weeks, a group of soldiers from Spokane are ambushed in an Iraqi city.
     Back stateside we follow four of them: a surgeon who saw too much; a teacher who's a single mom and who lost a hand in the ambush; 
     an infantry man whose best friend died that day; and a soldier who keeps reliving the moment he killed a civilian woman. Each has 
     come home changed and feeling dislocated. Group therapy, V.A. services, halting gestures from family and colleagues, and regular 
     flashbacks keep the war front and center in their minds. They're angry, touchy, and explosive. Can a warrior find peace back home?
