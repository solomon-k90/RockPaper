        The boy was very talented but was not given enough time by his parents, he was a very talented player but he was not given enough support
            from his parents,his parents wanted him to be a software engineer but he had no intrest in that and he knew that he was a gifted player 
            everybody loved to watch him whenever he played  in school even the old teachers fell in love with the way he played they all knew one day 
            he will make history in the their community,but the problem was that he parents had an opposition to that they wanted him to consentrate on
            his studies so that he will make them proud by becoming a software engineer. The boy knew his country need some one like him so he didn't want 
            to let his gift to waste so he had to run from his community to the city
