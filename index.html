   <h1><u>HE MAKES THINGS BEAUTIFUL</u></h1>
        <p>I was once disturbed about how long it is taking for me to achieve my dreams. I walkd up to a mentor who 
            counselled and comforted my heart. It was such a great experience speaking to my mentor. He asked me to list
            5 thing that will give mean I have achieved my dreams, they are
               <ol>
                <li>University degree</li>
                <li>Marriage</li>
                <li>Friendship</li>
                <li>Family</li>
                <li>Income</li>
               </ol>

               <ol type="i">
                <li>degree</li>
                <li>Marriage</li>
                <li>Friendship</li>
                <li>Family</li>
                <li>Income</li>
               </ol>
        He gave me steps to take in no particular order, they include;
        <ul>
            <li>Focus.</li>
            <li>Determination. </li>
            <li>Skills.</li>
            <li>God. Having a relationship with God produces peace and wisdom needed to succeed.</li>
        </ul>  
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Focus</dt>
            <dd>This is the process of having undivided attention to achieve great result.</dd>
            <dt>Determination</dt>
            <dd>This is the process of overcoming challenges on my path to greatness.</dd>
            <dt>Skills</dt>
            <dd>This is the process of acquiring relevant skills that will help in achieving my dreams.</dd>
        </dl>

<p>The rate at which things are expensive these days is a cause for concern. Imagine going to the market with
    a huge amount of money. For example, a bag of rice is #80000. I will share some more for your peruse.

        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Garri</li>
        <ul>
