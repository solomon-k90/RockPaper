        <p>The boy was very talented but was not given enough time by his parents, he was a very talented player but he was not given enough support
            from his parents,his parents wanted him to be a software engineer but he had no intrest in that and he knew that he was a gifted player 
            everybody loved to watch him whenever he played  in school even the old teachers fell in love with the way he played they all knew one day 
            he will make history in the their community,but the problem was that he parents had an opposition to that they wanted him to consentrate on
            his studies so that he will make them proud by becoming a software engineer. The boy knew his country need some one like him so he didn't want 
            to let his gift to waste so he had to run from his community to the city where he went to stay in his fiends house he lied to his friends parents
            that he came to write an exam for final screening into the university so the boys parents allowed him to stay with them.He disovered that there was
            a local stadium where the local team trained he got there and started going for tranning every evening and he eventual became part of the team 
            one day his team was playing a match and were two goals down,the boy was on the beanch and the match was to end after five minutes the sub was made 
            and he came in to play and within the five minutes he gave an asist and later scored when it was just 30second left to end the match every body was 
            so  happy with him. Luckily for him a big team in europe sent scouts to the match and they asked he if he was willing to play for the club he agreed 
            and was taken abroad he started his carier  and ended it sucessfully acheving alot for himself and both club and country
